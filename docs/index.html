    <h1>Linux Cheatsheets</h1>

    <p>These  are some basic Linux cheatsheets I put together.  They aren't full
    references for any of the commands they mention. They're intended for people
    who haven't worked with these systems before and just need a refresher or an
    overview. If you need details, see Google or the <code>man</code> pages.</p>

    <p>All the commands listed should work on any Linux system. Virtually all of
    them will also run unchanged on Mac OSX. If you're on Windows you're on your
    own... good luck!</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A <a href="bash.html">Bash Cheatsheet</a> for the GNU Bourne-Again SHell.</li>
      <li>A <a href="git.html">Git Cheatsheet</a> for that Stupid Content Tracker.</li>
    </ul>
